My dotfiles that I wish to cary around. Note that the emacs stuff is
in the .emacs.d repo.

Note that the .gitconfig file is constructed from 2 files:

.gitconfig-base: contains all the config shared among multiple
                 environment (aliases, colors, etc.)

.gitconfig-head: contains the information specific to an environment
                 (github token, commit address, etc.)

The head file within the dotfile folder is a templated that is copied
over into the home folder when the setup script is first executed. This
means that after the template has been copied over, you should modify
the file and run the setup script again to form the final .gitconfig.

The whole point of this convoluted process is to not have secret
information in plain sight on github while still having an easy way to
shared a git configuration file.
