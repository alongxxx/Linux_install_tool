The Silver Searcher
A code searching tool similar to ack, with a focus on speed.

Do you know C? I invite you to pair with me to help me get to Ag 1.0.

What's so great about Ag?

It is an order of magnitude faster than ack.
It ignores file patterns from your .gitignore and .hgignore.
If there are files in your source repo you don't want to search, just add their patterns to a .agignore file. (*cough* extern *cough*)
The command name is 33% shorter than ack, and all keys are on the home row!
Ag is quite stable now. Most changes are new features, minor bug fixes, or performance improvements. It's much faster than Ack in my benchmarks:

ack test_blah ~/code/  104.66s user 4.82s system 99% cpu 1:50.03 total

ag test_blah ~/code/  4.67s user 4.58s system 286% cpu 3.227 total
Ack and Ag found the same results, but Ag was 34x faster (3.2 seconds vs 110 seconds). My ~/code directory is about 8GB. Thanks to git/hg/svn-ignore, Ag only searched 700MB of that.

There are also graphs of performance across releases.

How is it so fast?

Ag uses Pthreads to take advantage of multiple CPU cores and search files in parallel.
Files are mmap()ed instead of read into a buffer.
Literal string searching uses Boyer-Moore strstr.
Regex searching uses PCRE's JIT compiler (if Ag is built with PCRE >=8.21).
Ag calls pcre_study() before executing the same regex on every file.
Instead of calling fnmatch() on every pattern in your ignore files, non-regex patterns are loaded into arrays and binary searched.
I've written several blog posts showing how I've improved performance. These include how I added pthreads, wrote my own scandir(), benchmarked every revision to find performance regressions, and profiled with gprof and Valgrind.

Building from source

Install dependencies (Automake, pkg-config, PCRE, LZMA):

OS X:

brew install automake pkg-config pcre xz
or

port install automake pkgconfig pcre xz
Ubuntu/Debian:

apt-get install -y automake pkg-config libpcre3-dev zlib1g-dev liblzma-dev
Fedora:

yum -y install pkgconfig automake gcc zlib-devel pcre-devel xz-devel
CentOS:

yum -y groupinstall "Development Tools"
yum -y install pcre-devel xz-devel
Windows: It's complicated. See this wiki page.
Run the build script (which just runs aclocal, automake, etc):

./build.sh
On Windows:

  mingw32-make -f Makefile.w32
Make install:

sudo make install
Editor Integration

Vim

You can use Ag with ack.vim by adding the following line to your .vimrc:

let g:ackprg = 'ag --nogroup --nocolor --column'
or:

let g:ackprg = 'ag --vimgrep'
Which has the same effect but will report every match on the line.

There's also a fork of ack.vim tailored for use with Ag: ag.vim

Emacs

You can use ag.el as an Emacs fronted to Ag.

TextMate

TextMate users can use Ag with my fork of the popular AckMate plugin, which lets you use both Ack and Ag for searching. If you already have AckMate you just want to replace Ack with Ag, move or delete "~/Library/Application Support/TextMate/PlugIns/AckMate.tmplugin/Contents/Resources/ackmate_ack" and run ln -s /usr/local/bin/ag "~/Library/Application Support/TextMate/PlugIns/AckMate.tmplugin/Contents/Resources/ackmate_ack"

Contributing

I like when people send pull requests. It validates my existence. If you want to help out, check the issue list or search the codebase for TODO. Don't worry if you lack experience writing C. If I think a pull request isn't ready to be merged, I'll give feedback in comments. Once everything looks good, I'll comment on your pull request with a cool animated gif and hit the merge button.

Other stuff you might like

Ack - Better than grep. Without Ack, Ag would not exist.
AckMate - An ack-powered replacement for TextMate's slow built-in search.
ack.vim
ag.vim
Exuberant Ctags - Faster than Ag, but it builds an index beforehand. Good for really big codebases.
Git-grep - As fast as Ag but only works on git repos.
Sack - A utility that wraps Ack and Ag. It removes a lot of repetition from searching and opening matching files.
